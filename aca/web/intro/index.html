		<p>HTML, also known as HyperText Markup Language is the primary language of the internet. It is capable of giving you a wide variety of possibilities such as tables, images, and moving text. However, it does not allow you to alter the way the objects, or, elements of the page are shown.</p>
		</br>
		<p>CSS, Cascading Style Sheets is used for this, in ways such as changing color, position and even doing things like pop-up menus.</p>
		<p>Although, for the last item, JavaScript may be more recommended. A script is a series of actions to be done. JavaScript and PHP are the most common languages for such actions.</p>
		<p>PHP is used more for one-time actions, such as adding a new user. This is often done while using a database system such as MySQL, or NoSQL for more irregular cases.</p>
		<p>By the way, if you wanted something like a messaging app where you need more contributions to the database, you might rather use NodeJS, a port of JavaScript that can run on the server.</p>
		<p>There are other web technologies, such as WebSockets, or Gemini, but here we will only be focusing on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, as these are the only necessary to make most apps on the modern web.</p>
		</br>
		<p>Going back, without page elements, which are defined through HTML, none of the other technologies mentioned so far would work.</p>
		<h3 class = "subheading">Write And Test</h3>
		<p>To create and write a html file, if you are on Windows you may want to first check that you have file extensions enabled. To do this open file explorer, click view and you should see the option to enable them.</p>
		<p>The file can have any name. index.html is used by default as the homepage in a folder on servers.</p>
		<p>The word index, by the way, possibly meaning something akin to "menu".</p>
		</br>
		<p>Opening this file once in a browser, such as Chrome, Opera, Brave, and so on, and once in a file editor, you can now begin.</p>
		<p>Inside the file editor you may write some text, save, then refreshing inside the browser. This happens to be the process you will use always for testing code.</p>
		<p>Oftentimes issues happen not because there is something wrong with the code, but because you have forgotten one of these 3 steps.</p>

			<li>Write</li>
			<li>Save</li>
			<li>Refresh</li>
		</ol>
