		<h3 id = "#headandbody" class = "subheading">Head and Body</h3>
		<p>HTML, which we established in the last episode as the only essential language of the modern web, works by defining elements.</p>
		<p>One such element is the body element. This is an element that is not shown on the screen, but which helps define the structure of the markup. </p>
		<p>Another element is the head, often added above the body, to signify the relationship the two have.</p>
		<p>The head gives primarly data about the body, which is the content that is shown to the user.</p>
		</br>
		<p>To actually write such content you may write simple text, however you will quickly notice that HTML is designed so that writing text on multiple lines on multiple lines does not actually make new lines appear.</p>
		<p>This is because if that was so the body and head elements you may have attempted to add would count and add new lines. </p>

		<h3 id = "paragraphs" class = "subheading">Paragraphs</h3>
		<p>As such, the clearest solution is to make text display on multiple lines using an element known as paragraph. This element is used to show, or, delimit, where the paragraph starts with a starting tag and where it ends with an ending tag.</p>
		<p>An example of two paragraphs would be: </p>
<pre><code>&ltp&gtAnna has an apple.&lt/p&gt
&ltp&gtPears are healthy.&lt/p&gt</code></pre>
		</br>

		<p>This ensures that the two paragraphs will display on unique lines within the webpage.</p>

		<h3 id = "headings" class = "subheading">Headings</h3>
		<p>Another element is the h1 element, and more such heading elements, "h", up to the fifth heading element, h5.</p>
		<p>Try this:</p>
		<code>&lth1&gtHeading&lt/h1&gt</code>
		<p>Try adding more such heading elements yourself.</p>
		<p>For example,</p>
<pre><code>&lth2&gtSubheading&lt/h2&gt
&lth1&gtHeading 2&lt/h1&gt
&lth2&gtSubheading&lt/h2&gt</code></pre>
		</br>
		<p>You will typically not have to go above h3 unless what you are working on is very complex. If you find yourself going above h3 in a simple page, it may be a sign that you are assuming things which are actually important words to be headings. Such words can be marked with <b>inline</b> elements, as below:</p>
<pre><code>&lth2&gtApple&lt/h2&gt
&ltp&gtApple is &ltb&gtjuicy&lt/b&gt because of it's high content of [...] and has the &ltb&gtcolor&lt/b&gt varieties it has because of [...].&lt/p&gt</code></pre>
		
		<h3 id = "textformatting" class = "subheading">Text Formatting</h3>
		<p>Other inline elements are the "i" element - written <i></i> and used for marking text up to display as italic; the underline element - or "u" element - <u></u>; and more elements for marking up the formatting of the text.</p>
		<p>Such elements used to determine the form the text will take are known as HTML formatting elements.</p>

		<h3 id = "images" class = "subheading">Images</h3>
		<p>The name "formatting elements" is somewhat misleading though, because other ways to mark the format of the text exist. One such way is encoding an image into text in such a way that it can then be sent over a connection and receieved at the destination, forming what we would see as an image.</p>
		<p>For this, it is important to convert files to more spacesaving formats such as webp, the "web picture" format.</p>
		<p>These images can then be displayed using the image element. This is the first element we will encounter which does not have an ending tag, instead using a forward slash at it's end.</p>
		</br>
		<p>This is one example of the image tag:</p>
		<code>&ltimg src = "berry.webp" alt = "A berry" /&gt</code>
		</br>

		<p>The alt <b>attribute</b> is important as alternative text for those viewers using programs that read the pages out loud, which would otherwise have no way to experience the image, but based on the context.</p>
		<p>Such context may involve a discussion of berries - as such the source image may be titled "berry.webp".</p>
		<p>By the way, one such webpage could involve this body of text:</p>

<pre><code>&ltbody&gt
     &lth1&gtBerries&lt/h1&gt
     &ltp&gtA berry is a common type of fruit found around the world. Botanically, a berry is an ovary, a part of the plant reproductive organ, surrounded by an edible fleshy portion, known as a pericarp.&lt/p&gt
     &ltimg src = "berry.webp" alt = "A berry" /&gt
     &lth2&gtStrawberries&lt/h2&gt
     &ltp&gtAlso known as garden strawberries, from a botanical point of view, these are not actually berries, the fleshy part originating not from the ovary, but [...]&lt/p&gt
&lt/body&gt</code></pre>
		</br>

		<p>When you can access the internet, you can publish this webpage on hosting platforms, such as, for free, on Github pages.</p>
		<p>However, if you were to do so, you would have to add a few details about the page.</p>
		<p>These details are, as always, used to mark up how the page should be displayed. One such element which can be added inside the head is the title element.</p>

		<h3 id = "title" class = "subheading">Webpage Titles</h3>
		<code>&lttitle&gtElkia Academy&lt/title&gt</code>
		<p>This title will determine the way the tab is titled, and the title that will often appear when you link the webpage on websites that choose to display the title together with links.</p>

		<h3 id = "description" class = "subheading">Webpage Descriptions</h3>
		<p>Another piece of data that is commonly displayed are descriptions.</p>
		<p>One such description would be:</p>
		<code>&ltmeta name = "description" content = "Free Tutorials for all, helping you achieve your dreams and live a life of harmony and abundance." /&gt</code>
		</br>

		<p>You may notice webpage descriptioins and titles that include what is most important and which distinguishes the most first.</p>
		<p>To understand why this may matter, imagine two things: 1. Your user has more than ten tabs open (maybe they are researching something); 2. This is the best way to impact the user in one or two words.</p>
		<p>If we had written:</p>
		<code>&ltmeta name = "description content = "Helping you achieve your dreams and live a life of harmony and abundance through free tutorials for all." /&gt</code>
		</br>
		<p>The focus is not on the user, but on Elkia Academy.</p>
		<p>The customer will always be self-focused. If customers use an application only out of politeness, it is typically a form of self-sabotage for both.</p>
		<p>Speaking of self-focused, devices have varied resolutions.</p>

		<h3 id = "responsive" class = "subheading">Responsive One-liner</h3>
		<p>If you wish to adjust your webpage to unique device resolutions, one simple line is:</p>
		<code>&ltmeta name = "viewport" content = "width=device-width, initial-scale=1" /&gt</code>
		</br>
		<p>This ensures that on mobile devices which use virtual windows to allow zooming on text with fingers or otherwise, the viewport will always be set to:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Have a width equal to the device width.</li>
			<li>Have an initial zoom of "1" - 100%.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The viewport, by the way is the area of the screen where content is visible. This often becomes relevant if you wish to create browser games.</p>
		<h3 id = "htmlelement" class = "subheading">html Element</h3>
		<p>To finish off, you may enevelop the entire page in the html element. You will find out what lies outside the html element when we get to CSS briefly, and then as we learn about JavaScript.</p>

<pre><code>&lthtml&gt
     &lthead&gt
          &lttitle&gtElkia Academy&lt/title&gt
	  &ltmeta name = "description" content = "Free Tutorials for all, helping you achieve your dreams and live a life of harmony and abundance." /&gt
	  &ltmeta name = "viewport" content = "width=device-width, initial-scale=1" /&gt
     &lt/head&gt
     &ltbody&gt
          &lth1&gtBerries&lt/h1&gt
	  &ltp&gtA berry is a common type of fruit found around the world. Botanically, a berry is an ovary, a part of the plant reproductive organ, surrounded by an edible fleshy portion, known as a pericarp.&lt/p&gt
	  &ltimg src = "berry.webp" alt = "A berry" /&gt
	  &lth2&gtStrawberries&lt/h2&gt
	  &ltp&gtAlso known as garden strawberries, from a botanical point of view, these are not actually berries, the fleshy part originating not from the ovary, but [...]&lt/p&gt
     &lt/body&gt
&lt/html&gt</code></pre>

		<h3 id = "doctype" class = "subheading">Document Type Declaration</h3>
		<p>At last, the line <code>&lt!DOCTYPE html&gt</code> is used at the very top of the page, above the starting html tag, to mark that the file is modern HTML. </p>
		<p>Without this, the browser will revert to something called Quirks Mode, which is used to maintain compatibility with older webpages that did not have this declaration.</p>
		<p>This will only matter if you go and learn more advanced features such as CSS, however I thought I would mention it here as you will find it pretty much everywhere you go.</p>

		<h3 id = "prelude" class = "subheading">Prelude to Part 2</h3>
		<p>To add languages other than English, and create links, lists, tables, and use other features such as webpage icons, check out part 2 of HTML basics.</p>
